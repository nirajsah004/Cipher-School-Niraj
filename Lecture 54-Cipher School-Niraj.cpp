/*
in this class we discussed about linked list and why we use it instead of an array the reason being that the array
is not flexible if we want to insert and element at an index we need to swap all the following elements also
same goes for deleting the elements in an array, we also cant insert an element after the size of array is full


Linked list has a node that further has data and address of next element stored in it so linked list is basically
collection of nodes.

These nodes are in series and stores data and address of next element
