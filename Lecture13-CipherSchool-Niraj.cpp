/*
in this class we discussed about function and what are they used for?
so function is basically a task that is performed.
a function has a header and a body(contains the task to perform)


Advantage of using function:
--reuseablity   -->we can use a function again and agian this saves times
--abstraction   -->hides the useless information from the user
--divivde and conqure   -->divide the task in small parts and solve our problem
--improve redability    -->helps to make code more cleaner and easily understandable
