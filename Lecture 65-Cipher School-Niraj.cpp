/* in this lecture we learned about quick sort and how we are going to use quick sort using recursion in 
this sorting we will make our array in this way such that there is an element that will retain its position
 throughout the sorting that element needs to be created first and that can be done by sorting the first element
 in its best location where all elements to the right are bigger than that element and all of them elements to the
 left are smaller element then we will start the sorting
