/* we saw in class that the diffrence between x and x^2 is very large as the size of x increases the time taken
by the compiler to execute the code will increase a lot that in relation to x

so we need a code with complexity in kx

we need to ignore the constants (they dont matter in large data sets)
we need to ignore the lower order terms(at larger scale they diminish)

Asymptotic relationship is relation between two equations at infinity and this tends to be a large value

BIG O NOTATION is asymtotic upper bound 
BIG OMEGA is the aymptotic lower bound 
BIG THETHA is the middle bound of two values
