/*in this class we discussed about which algorithm we shoul use as there are a number of solution for one problem
so this depends on th eproblem for example if we want to use insertion sort on a small data it might take a small
amount of time but on the same time if used on a large data set that will take a while to execute as the time complexity
of insertion sort is o(n^2) and this will increase the time because of data size that is why we need to analyze 
problem befor applying a algorithm*/
